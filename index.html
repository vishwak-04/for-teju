    <h1>Hey.</h1>

    <p>
      Hi.. welcome to my page. Hope you like this :) <3
    </p>

    <p>
      I created this just to share a small note. I understand why you feel so tired and exhausted. I gave you reasons to be so.
      
      I care deeply for you and ourselves, and I'm working on showing how I care for you, and not just say repeatedly the same thing.

    <p>
      I’m taking this seriously; not by explaining again and again,
      but by learning to listen better and act differently.
    </p>

    <p class="closing">
      No pressure. I just wanted you to know this matters to me. I'm here, ready to listen to you and willing to do anything to restart this.
      I love you so much <3
    </p>
